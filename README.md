Hospital Service Management System – Database Design Project

This project is the final assignment for the Database Design course. It focuses on designing and implementing a relational database system for managing hospital and medical center services. The goal is to model an efficient system that supports essential clinical and administrative operations, such as managing patient records, appointments, medical histories, and payment information.


🧩 Project Phases

Phase 1 — Requirements Analysis

Identifying all system requirements and defining the scope.
Recognizing key entities, relationships, and functional needs.

Phase 2 — Conceptual Design

Creating an Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD) based on the requirements.
Using tools such as Microsoft Visio to visually represent entities, attributes, and relationships.
Refining the conceptual model to ensure correctness and consistency.

Phase 3 — Logical Design & Implementation

Converting the ERD into relational schemas.
Implementing the database using SQL Server.
Using SQL commands to:

Create tables
Define primary and foreign keys
Enforce constraints
Populate sample data
Test system functionality

🛠 Technologies Used

Microsoft SQL Server
Microsoft Visio
SQL (DDL & DML)

🎯 Project Goals

Applying database design principles to a real-world scenario
Practicing conceptual and logical modeling
Implementing a functional relational database system
Demonstrating understanding of SQL and data modeling
